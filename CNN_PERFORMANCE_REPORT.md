## üéØ Key Findings

### Strengths
- **Excellent footwear recognition:** Sandal (99.4%), Sneaker (97.0%), Ankle boot (98.0%)
- **Strong accessory recognition:** Bag (99.2%)
- **Good bottom-wear classification:** Trouser (98.7%)
- **High confidence levels:** 96.4% average confidence indicates model certainty

### Challenges
- **Upper-body garment confusion:** Shirt vs T-shirt/top distinction is problematic
- **Pullover classification:** Various pullover styles cause confusion
- **Fine detail recognition:** Missing subtle differences in similar garments

## üí° Improvement Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Focus on Shirt class:** Only 80.9% accuracy - significant improvement needed
2. **Address T-shirt/top confusion:** 90.4% accuracy with likely confusion between similar items
3. **Enhance pullover recognition:** 92.3% accuracy suggests style variation challenges

### Technical Solutions
1. **Enhanced Architecture:** Deeper CNN with better attention mechanism
2. **Class-weighted Training:** Higher weights for underperforming classes (especially Shirt: 1.164x weight)
3. **Advanced Data Augmentation:** Rotation, translation, elastic deformation
4. **Focal Loss:** Focus training on hard examples

### Expected Improvements
- **Target Overall Accuracy:** 95-97%
- **Shirt:** 80.9% ‚Üí 88-92%
- **T-shirt/top:** 90.4% ‚Üí 93-95%
- **Pullover:** 92.3% ‚Üí 94-96%
