# PyTorch Project Starter

This project is set up for learning and experimenting with PyTorch.

## Structure

- `src/` : Source code for experiments and models
- `README.md` : Project overview and instructions

## Getting Started

1. Activate your conda environment:

   ```zsh
   conda activate pytorch_learn_env
   ```

2. Run your scripts from the `src/` folder.

## Useful Commands

- Install new packages: `conda install <package>`
- Run a script: `python src/your_script.py`

## Next Steps

- Try running a simple PyTorch script in `src/` to test your setup.
